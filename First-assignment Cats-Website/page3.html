    <h2> The cat in cultural traditions and religious beliefs</h2>

      </figure>
      In Medieval Europe cats were  viewed with deep suspicion, if not with outright hatred. 
      Although it was appreciated that cats kep rodents away from the homes, cats were also associated with evil. 
      Anyone who had the misfortune to come across a black cat, would have expected a visit from Satan himself, 
      as the cat could well be his disguise among the people. 
      Especially during the period of the Plague, cats (together with elderly women) were blamed for the outbreaks, while during the religious wars that divided Europe, cats were the symbol of heretical movements. 
      Cats were killed and burnt en masse  for this reason. </p>
   <p class="a"> Cats were slowly rehabilitated from the late Renaissance onwards. For instance, under the reign of French Louis XIV, 
    it was no longer allowed to burn cats on the stake during the feast of 
            Saint John the Baptist.</p>
      <p class="a">
      In contrast, several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, 
      companions or guides for humans, who are all-knowing 
    but silent as not to interfere in humans' decision-making. 
      In Japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune, whereas in Norse mythology, Freyja, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.</p>
      <p class="a">
      In the Middle East, cats were intimately involved in the daily life of the people. According to Jewish legend, the first cat was living in the house of the first man Adam as a pet that got rid of mice. The cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals.
       It is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water.
       Although no species are sacred in Islam, cats are revered by Muslims. 
       Some  writers have stated Muhammad had a favorite cat, Muezza. 
       He is reported to have loved cats so much, 
       "he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one 
       that was sleeping on it". 
       The story has no origin in early Muslim writers, 
       and seems to confuse a story of a later Sufi saint, Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, 
       centuries after Muhammad.

        <h3>Ancient Egypt</h3>
        <p class="a">Cats were represented in social and religious practices of ancient Egypt for more than 3,000 years. 
          Several ancient Egyptian deities were depicted and sculptured with cat-like heads such as Mafdet, 
          Bastet and Sekhmet, representing justice, fertility and power.
          The deity Mut was also depicted as a cat and in the company of a cat</p>
          <p class="a">Mafdet was the first known cat-headed deity in ancient Egypt. 
            During the First Dynasty, she was regarded as protector of the pharaoh's chambers against snakes, 
            scorpions and evil. She was often also depicted with a head of a leopard (<i>Panthera pardus</i>) 
            or a cheetah (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i>).
            <figure class="figure-text" style="float:right;">

            <figcaption>The goddess Bastet <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_in_ancient_Egypt" class="href">(Wikipedia)</a></figcaption></figure>
            She was particularly prominent during the reign of Den.
            The deity Bastet is known from at least the Second Dynasty onwards. 
            At the time, she was depicted with a lion (Panthera leo) head. 
            Seals and stone vessels with her name were found in the tombs of the pharaohs Khafre and 
            Nyuserre Ini, indicating that she was regarded as protector since the mid 30th century BC during the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties. 
            A wall painting in the Fifth Dynasty's burial ground at Saqqara shows a small cat with a collar, 
            suggesting that tamed African wildcats were kept in the pharaonic quarters by the 26th century BC.</p>

    <h3>The cat in European Christianity</h3>
    <p class="a">The loathing of cats was particularly widespread in Western Europe, as they were commonly associated with witchcraft and heretical movements. 
      In Western Europe cats were therefore often tortured and mass-burned. Especially in this, France and Spain distinguished themselves. 
      In his book "Ivan the Terrible: The Bloody Poet", in response to accusations of Western European authors 
      and ideologists against Russia of savagery and barbarism, 
      the famous historian Aleksandr Bushkov writes:
<div class="text-citation">"The French had a "nice" habit of burning and hanging cats on the day of John the Baptist. 
How they annoyed the French so much remains a mystery. The differences between the regions are solely in the specifics of the process: in Paris, 
cats were stuffed into a bag, hung it higher, and then set on fire. 
In Saint-Chamond, cats were doused with resin, set on fire, and then chased through the streets. 
In Burgundy and Lorraine, before setting fire to the "May pole", a cat was bound to it."</div>

        <p class="a">In contrast, in traditional Slavic cultures, the cat was revered, as it drove away both rodents and evil spirits. 
          Seven years of bad luck would befall to the person who killed a cat. The ancient Slavs considered the cat a messenger from the earth god Veles, 
          bringer of fertility, good fortune and wealth.</p>
